## 🌍 About Me

I'm an aerospace engineering student passionate about lightweight structures, simulation-driven development, and solving complex technical challenges.  
I enjoy combining analytical thinking, numerical methods, and clean code to build efficient engineering tools and models.

I’m also part of **Odonata e.V. – Human Powered Aircraft**, a student-driven project developing an ultra-light human-powered aircraft.  
Working in this team deepens my interest in **lightweight engineering**, structural design, and performance-oriented development, especially in contexts where every gram matters.
You can learn more about our mission here: **https://hpa-odonata.de/**  

I'm always learning something new, currently diving deeper into: **C++**, **Docker**, and **embedded systems**
